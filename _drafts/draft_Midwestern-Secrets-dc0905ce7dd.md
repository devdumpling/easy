It’s a good place to die.

There’s a solemn beach outlet nestled against the quaint campus streets of Madison, Wisconsin. In order to get there, climb through the brush obscuring the busy trails running from the Union Terrace, where students of UW Madison enjoy bratwurst and pitchers of Blue Moon. 

It doesn’t seem that long ago that I asked why the obsession with bratwurst, nor was it that long ago that the question was ignored and filed away with the other mysteries that The Midwest tends to hide. 

Once you’re through the brush, make your way down to the edge of the lake. Follow the edge, either by wetting your feet or hopping from one slick stone to the next. After a bit you’ll come to a point where there are no more stones, and it’s simply beach.
