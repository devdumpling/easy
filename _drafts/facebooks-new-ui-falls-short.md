## Facebook’s New UI Falls Short

Let’s break down the good, bad, and ugly

Facebook is no stranger to redesigns. They’ve done major overhauls of both Facebook and Instagram over the years, and they’re almost always met with some level of disdain. Usually, I think the disdain is overdramatized, as it takes time to get used to a new UI. But over time, users find the new features they like, adapt to a new flow, and forget about the gripes they had.

However, this time the disdain feels warranted.

The old UI had its share of problems. It was cluttered and felt like all of the minor additions Facebook made over the years had randomly come together to form the amalgamation that it was. So, it’s not surprising they’ve redesigned it. I expected some level of clean up, maybe some new features, a sleeker feel, etc.

But what in God’s name… is this.
