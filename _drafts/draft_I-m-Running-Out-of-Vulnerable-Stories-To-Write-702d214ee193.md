Alright, okay, yeah we can do this. Here we go.

Yep, another vulnerable story about that thing that was awful and then turned out to be a good thing. Medium eats this shit up, right? Where’s my checklist.

> Okay, okay, interesting but not too clickbaity headline. **Check**.  
> Happy ending that leaves you feeling good. **Check**.  
> Things that give value to the reader. Uhh… **check**, I guess.  
> Sappy, half-hearted prose to warm you up. **Check**.

I’m fucking tired of it.

This is how I feel all of my articles sound right now. 

_“Oh, don’t fret! You have to write 10 million words, an article every day, and learn the hard way just like all of us before anyone takes you seriously!”_

Ok. Cool. Real appealing, fam. Is this how every profession inspires ambitious young blood to pursue their dreams in it? Gag.
