Thanks for the writeup. It's great Google is offering accessible options, but I'm tired of eLearning minimizing what goes into a Comp. Sci degree. As others have noted, it's more than hard skills.

I wrote a sloppy article about this a while ago ([https://medium.com/@devon.wells.a/developer-culture-check-2e2fb9842b57](https://medium.com/@devon.wells.a/developer-culture-check-2e2fb9842b57)), but the TL;DR is that we need to promote options like what Google is offering without trying to cast each option as a fit for what the other options offer. They are inherently different educations with different benefits.

While all of them might be valuable resources for the industry, they aren't perfectly interchangeable, and pretending so devalues all of them.
