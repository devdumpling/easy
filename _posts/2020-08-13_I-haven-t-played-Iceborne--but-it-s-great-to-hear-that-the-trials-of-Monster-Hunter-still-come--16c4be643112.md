I haven't played Iceborne, but it's great to hear that the trials of Monster Hunter still come through. I always thought MHW felt too easy compared to the original MH, and that the sense of ecstatic accomplishment you describe, which can only come from brutally losing over and over, was lost on the newer game.

Thanks for the writeup. I'll have to pick up Iceborne to try Alatreon at some point on my own.
