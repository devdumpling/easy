When the socks  
shed their lint;

when the long island  
stains the table;

when the chain drinks  
and the bike croaks;

when a peek under the stall  
finds awkward  
familiar eyes;

_when the panda makes a mean face;  
when the blackboard eraser smells;  
when on waking Sunday morning,  
it rains,_

and Death knocks,  
but youâ€™re still in the shower.

_inspired by a quote from F.L.C.L._
