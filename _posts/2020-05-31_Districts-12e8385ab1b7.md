### Districts

### Districts across the land work to produce goods and maintain a status quo.

### Many of those that work the hardest starve…

### while those in power live in luxury.

#### Every year, a few innocents are killed by the state with no repercussions.

#### The entire public watches year after year, until eventually the tension is too much.

### Riots break out across the country, demanding change.

### Police are deployed to quell the uprisings, sending a clear message from those in power.

### Oh, I’m sorry.

#### Did you think I was talking about the U.S.A.?

#### **That was actually the plot to The Hunger Games.**
