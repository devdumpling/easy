that wide-eyed boy,  
wrapped in blue clouds  
at the breakfast table  
drunk on sun and  
cheerios,  
siphoning Saturday  
morning like  
french kissing honeysuckle.

It was back in those days,  
of new friends and  
spelling quizzes when  
mom and sis would  
work at the hospital on  
weekends, leaving dad and  
me to tend the house, or  
more often, the house to tend  
dad and me,  
that the world would open its  
doors. And that’s all they were —   
not some grandiose truth or  
eternal bliss, just  
doors, mouseholes even.

They lead to  
blackberry bushes,  
candy stores, a piggy  
back ride around the  
cul de sac, and they  
came and went  
as morning dew  
lining the stem of  
childhood, oh

do I remember.
