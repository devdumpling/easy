Thinking about scheduling an hour-long “touchpoint” to discuss that \[PERSON\] needs to complete \[TASK\] by \[DEADLINE\]?

Think again.

An elite team of Harvard-educated science-folk found shocking evidence that the majority of meetings are redundant and can be replaced with a simple email. The study is still highly classified, but lucky for you, I got insider information on how to use the results for good. What follows are step-by-step instructions on how to increase team productivity, morale, and make you look like a hero.

#### 1\. Open your email

If you’re having trouble with this step, cancel all of your meetings for the day. Pull up a guide on email. You’ve got bigger problems to fry.

#### 2\. Think about what you were going to say in the meeting

Hold that thought in your head.

#### 3\. Write it in an email

Take those thoughts and write them down. Use a spellchecker, re-read your email for obvious errors. Be clear and concise. Our Harvard scientists tell us:

> “Having your email readable is the whole damn point and will make people not hate you.”

#### 4\. Send the email and move on

Congratulations, your coworkers now think of you as a divine being.

You single-handedly gave them space to give more than a forced moment’s thought to \[TASK\], while not compromising their schedule. Not only that, \[PERSON\] can respond in a polished manner, one that allows for the full opportunity for them to carefully elaborate from the position of expertise that they’re paid for, instead of being rushed into an on-the-fly decision about something they were probably already working on.

Go ahead and take a celebratory lap around your home office, you legend, you.
