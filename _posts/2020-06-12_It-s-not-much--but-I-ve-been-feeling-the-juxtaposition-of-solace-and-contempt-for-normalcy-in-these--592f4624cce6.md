It's not much, but I've been feeling the juxtaposition of solace and contempt for normalcy in these dire times. I wrote about it and a few other things on my mind recently, including how frustrating it is to see some white vegans trivialize the BLM, and a satirical piece on calling the neighbors on cops instead of vice versa. Thank you for the opportunity to share.
