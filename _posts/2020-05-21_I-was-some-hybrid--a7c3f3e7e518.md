I was some hybrid. I remember I ruined my build at one point because I thought that I could go dexless, but then realized I couldn’t fund it. Even if I could fund it, I would’ve still done negligible damage compared to the other warrior classes. I realize now Paladin was the 4th job, which I never got, but it started at Page and then became (I think) White Knight.

I switched and started building toward an HP Warrior instead, which was fun because at least then I was making a point with my uselessness.

I remember those 10%/60% quests! They were all the rage if you had the patience (which, let’s be honest, was like the entire game).
