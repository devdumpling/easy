This is awesome! I wish I had found this earlier. I was just trying to figure out the average MMR of pro players and how many games I'd have to play to get there, but as you mention these stats aren't exactly straightforward.

Thank you for all your work on stats and datdota. I used it a fair bit when I was researching and over the years as a player.

Keep up the good work!
