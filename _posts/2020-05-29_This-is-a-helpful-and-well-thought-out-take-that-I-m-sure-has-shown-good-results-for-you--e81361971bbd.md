This is a helpful and well-thought out take that I'm sure has shown good results for you. Per the documentation you've provided and other studies as you mention, there's a case for lower frequency training.

It's practical for beginners and intermediate lifters, but I think it's controversial to say that it's just as good if not better as others (James Wainwright) have stated.

While it's helpful to frame all of this in the light that different training routines ultimately should be personalized, and results can vary from any program, there's significant conflicting evidence on what you present.

I'm under the impression that recent studies have shown that while the beginner trainee will expect a 24hr recovery with 48 hour CNS recovery, intermediate and advanced trainees muscles adapt to have shorter recovery periods, 24 hours or less. This gave way to the recent trend of people hitting every muscle group every day--high frequency, low volume, 1 or 2 exercises per group (more or less). What are your thoughts on this?

Again, not saying you're wrong and no one should apply your approach, just that from what I understand there's more to it than just "less is more". At higher levels, which I think it seems like this article is meant to be for at least learned athletes, it's not as clear cut.

I can try to track down the studies if you like.

Thanks again for putting all this together. Not trying to take anything away from a solid writeup and good routine! Great stuff.
