# Easy: An enhanced version of Medium's Your Stories page

Medium.com has a clean, minimal UI. Most of it functions well and is easy to use. However, for whatever reason the "Your Stories" page is a huge pain in the rear. It shows all of a user's drafts and published posts, but with zero filtering or sorting options. This becomes a problem as you build a repetoire of stories, especially because Medium includes comments as stories.

To remedy this (and as a learning project in Next.js), I've created Easy.

Easy is a simple clone of Medium with the express goal of demonstrating an enhanced Stories page featuring search, filters, and sorting. It isn't meant to be an all-encompassing, perfect solution, rather a proof of concept.

I wrote an article walking through the reasoning, design, and build. I'm currently looking for a publication to house it in, but when it's available I will post it here. You can also find my Medium out at https://medium.com/@devon.wells.a for more info.

## TODO

--Fix nested dropdown in filter text alignment
--Add validation for dates
--fix sizing at small breakpoint (for some reason tailwind container syntax isn't working)
--Fix so that counts for drafts and published reflect the filtered results
